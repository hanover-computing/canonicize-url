> Get a stable, canonical version of any URL!

### Why

While `normalize-url` is good enough for many normalization use cases, this library is akin to prettier or black in that it goes even further and canonicizes links, such that for any "version" of a link, we reduce it down to its "base", canonical form.

This means you can essentially "deduplicate" N "variations" of links into its canonical form, which is really helpful when you need to do some amount of work for each link (i.e. you go from O(N) to O(1)).

Some of the "tricks" we use to canonicize URLs (beyond just what `normalize-url` provides you) include:

- default www-stripping and default https (both of which fallback to the original when the www-stripped or https versions do not exist - unlike `normalize-url`)
- stripping tracking search params in the querystring
- following redirects (even those that can't normally be automatically redirected without manual user intervention such as youtube redirect links)
- extracting canonical URLs that web pages use to indicate to web crawlers (e.g. Google) what the _canonical_ version of the link is

```js
import gen from 'canonicize-url'
const normalizeUrl = gen(normalizeUrlOptions, gotOptions) // it is recommended to fill out the caching options for got

const longDisgustingTrackerFilledLink =
  'https://www.amazon.com/Blanket-Fleece-Cartoon-Printing-Napping/dp/B089G4JDVB/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hello%20kitty&sr=8-1' // eww
await normalizeUrl(longDisgustingTrackerFilledLink) // https://amazon.com/Blanket-Fleece-Cartoon-Printing-Napping/dp/B089G4JDVB
```
